Bettertabs for Rails
====================

We know that splitting content into several tabs is easy, but doing well, clean, DRY, accessible, usable, fast and testable is not so simple after all.

Bettertabs is a simple `Rails 3.1+ Engine` that includes a **helper** and a **jquery plugin** to render the needed markup and javascript for a section with tabs in a easy and declarative way, forcing you to keep things simple and ensuring accessibility and usability, no matter if the content is loaded statically or via ajax.


## Features ##

Having to worry only on a few aspects like putting the content in the right site, you will have a site with tabs that:

  * Works with tabs for static, links or ajax loaded content
  * Works without javascript, so you can click on a tab before the whole page was loaded and it will work. Also it's usually much more easy to test.
  * It changes the URL (in HTML5 browsers, using [history.replaceState()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history)), so when you use the browser's back button, you'll land in the last selected tab. Also selected tabs can be permalinked.
  * Declarative code, that helps you to have your view code more readable and DRY
  * It has some basic error handling (like for example if the ajax loaded content returns an error, it redirects to the error page)
  * If you need more control in the javascript behavior, you can use some predefined jQuery events (for example: `$('#tabs').bind('bettertabs-before-ajax-loading', show_loading_clock);`)
  * The gem does not include any stylesheet, because each project has a different way of showing the tabs styles. Anyway the generated HTML is easy to style (see the [CSS Reference Guide](https://github.com/agoragames/bettertabs/blob/master/doc/STYLESHEETS-GUIDE.md))

## Try it out ##

The bettertabs gem includes a dummy test app, that is used for development (to execute rspec tests) and that can be easily launched to play with.

  * [Try online the demo app](http://bettertabs-demo.herokuapp.com)
  * Or to run it on your machine:
        
        $ git clone git://github.com/agoragames/bettertabs.git
        $ cd bettertabs
        /bettertabs$ bundle install
        /bettertabs$ bundle exec rackup config.ru


## Requirements: ##
  * Ruby 1.9.2
  * Rails 3.1+
  * [jquery-rails](https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails) with jQuery 1.3 or higher

Anyway you can use bettertabs without javascript (or use your own javascript handler) since the bettertabs helper only generates the appropriate markup.


## Install ##

Add bettertabs gem to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`.

    gem 'bettertabs'

To include the [jquery.bettertabs plugin](https://github.com/agoragames/bettertabs/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/jquery.bettertabs.js.coffee)
add these line to the top of your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` (**after** the *jQuery* library):

    //= require jquery.bettertabs

Or if you prefer the compressed version:

    //= require jquery.bettertabs.min

This works the same way as [jquery-rails](https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails); you don't need to copy-paste the javascript code in your app because it will be served using the Asset Pipeline.

## Usage and examples ##

Bettertabs supports three kinds of tabs:

  * **Link Tabs**: Loads only the active tab contents; when click on another tab, go to the specified URL. No JavaScript needed.
  * **Static Tabs**: Loads all content of all static tabs, but only show the active content; when click on another tab, activate its related content. When JavaScript disabled, it behaves like *link tabs*.
  * **Ajax Tabs**: Loads only the active tab contents; when click on another tab, loads its content via ajax and show. When JavaScript disabled, it behaves like *link tabs*.

An usage example should be self explanatory (using HAML, but it also works with ERB and other template systems):

    = bettertabs :profile_tabs, :selected_tab => :friends do |tab|
      = tab.static :general, 'My Profile' do
        %h2 General Info
        = show_user_general_info(@user)
          
      = tab.ajax :friends, :partial => 'shared/friends'
      
      = tab.link :groups do
        = render :partial => 'groups/user_groups', :locals => { :user => @user }

This will show three tabs: 'My Profile' (static, that will be preloaded and show when click in the tab), 'Friends' (ajax, that will load and show the content when click in the tab) and 'Groups' (link, that will reload the whole page).

The option `:selected_tab` specifies the default selected tab, when the page is loaded. It only defines which tab is selected when no `{bettertabs_id}_selected_tab` param is present.

The markup generated from Bettertabs consists of a tab list `<ul>` containing the tabs (one `<li>` containing a `<a>` per tab) and a `<div class="content">` for each tab holding the tab content.  
In case you want to render additional content between the tab list and the tab contents, you can do so by using `content_for :before_tab_id`:

    - content_for :before_profile_tabs do
      %p This content is rendered between tab list and tab content!

    = bettertabs :profile_tabs do |tab|
      = tab.static :general, 'My Profile' do
        Foo!

Note that the name of the `content_for` block must be consistent with id of the tabs (`bettertabs :profile_tabs` -> `content_for :before_profile_tabs`).

## Tabs Routes ##

By default, all tab links have the current url plus the `{bettertabs_id}_selected_tab` param with the tab_id value.

For example, if you are rendering the next bettertabs widget:

    = bettertabs :profile_tabs do |tab|
      = tab.static :general
      = tab.static :friends

in a view accessible by a route like this:

    match 'profile/:nickname', :to => 'profiles#lookup', :as => 'profile'

When you go to `/profile/dude`, your tabs links will have the following hrefs: 

  * :general tab href: `/profile/dude?profile_tabs_selected_tab=general`
  * :friends tab href: `/profile/dude?profile_tabs_selected_tab=friends`

If you're in a modern HTML5 browser then when click on a tab, the URL will change for one of the urls listed before (jquery.bettertabs), otherwise, you can turn the JavaScript off and the static tabs will become link tabs, so the URL will change as well.

To show a pretty url, you can just modify your named route to:

    match 'profile/:nickname(/:profile_tabs_selected_tab)', :to => 'profiles#lookup', :as => 'profile'

So now the tabs links will point to the following URLs:

  * :general tab href: `/profile/dude/general`
  * :friends tab href: `/profile/dude/friends`
  
  
## JavaScript with the jquery.bettertabs plugin #

The bettertabs helper will generate the needed markup that has an inline script at the bottom:

    jQuery(function($){ $('#bettertabs_id').bettertabs(); });

Which expects jQuery and jquery.bettertabs plugin to be present.

You can see the jquery.bettertabs source code in the github repo:

  * [CoffeeScript version](https://github.com/agoragames/bettertabs/raw/master/app/assets/javascripts/jquery.bettertabs.js.coffee)
  * [JavaScript (generated by coffee) version](https://github.com/agoragames/bettertabs/raw/master/app/assets/javascripts/jquery.bettertabs.js)
  * [Compressed JavaScript](https://github.com/agoragames/bettertabs/raw/master/app/assets/javascripts/jquery.bettertabs.min.js)
  
The plugin defines one single jQuery method `jQuery(selector).bettertabs();` that is applied to the generated markup.

This script will take the tab type from each tab link `data-tab-type` attribute (that can be "link", "static" or "ajax"), and will match each tab with its content using the tab link `data-show-content-id` attribute, that is the id of the related content.

Tabs of type "link" will be ignored, while "static" and "ajax" tabs will change the active content (using the `.active` css class), and also will try to change the current URL (browser history state)


### Browser history and url manipulation ###

When a tab is clicked, the plugin attempts to change the browser url to the tab link url to reflect the page state.

To change the url, the plugin defines the method `jQuery.Bettertabs.change_browser_url(new_url)`, that is internally called each time a tab is activated. This method is implemented using [history.replaceState()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history), which only works on modern HTM5 browsers (older browsers can not change the URL, and I prefer not trying to use History.js or any other approach to give them support for them).

The *jQuery.Bettertabs.change_url(url)* method is public, so it can be reused for other scripts (for example if you want to implement your own ajax pagination links inside the tab, and you want to reflect it in the browser bar). This also means that you can rewrite this method with your own implementation (to use another plugin like [History.js](https://github.com/balupton/history.js), [jQuery BBQ](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/), or [HTML5 pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) on your own if you want to change the browser url).


### Play with the bettertabs widget from other scripts ###

All parts of the bettertabs generated markup are identified using ids, so it is very easy to identify and modify any part of the inner content (just open your firebug and browse the generated markup).

You can interact with the bettertabs widget in the following ways:

  * **Activate a tab**: use the function `jQuery.Bettertabs.select_tab(bettertabsid, tabid);`, for the previous example could be *jQuery.Bettertabs.select_tab('profile_tabs', 'friends');*. You can also just simulate a click on the tab link with `jQuery('#tabid_bettertabsid_tab a').click();`
  * **Hook some behavior when a tab is clicked**: attach a 'click' handler to the tab link or use any of the provided custom events.
  * **Show a loading clock while ajax is loading**: or any other kind of feedback to the user, use any of the provided custom events. You can also handle it styling the CSS class `.ajax-loading` that is added to the ajax tab link while ajax content is loading (see the [Styles Reference Guide](https://github.com/agoragames/bettertabs/blob/master/doc/STYLESHEETS-GUIDE.md))
  * **Change the browser URL**: in the same way the plugin does when a tab is clicked, use `jQuery.Bettertabs.change_browser_url(new_url);`
  
Custom events that are attached to each tab content:

  * *'bettertabs-before-deactivate'*:   fired on content that is active and will be deactivated
  * *'bettertabs-before-activate'*:     fired on content that will be activated
  * *'bettertabs-before-ajax-loading'*: fired on content container that will be activated just before be loaded using ajax
  * *'bettertabs-after-deactivate'*:    fired on content that was deactivated
  * *'bettertabs-after-activate'*:      fired on content that was activated
  * *'bettertabs-after-ajax-loading'*:  fired on content after it was loaded via ajax. Remember that the content is loaded via ajax only once.

Usage example of custom events:

    // Show an alert when the :friends tab content of the :profile_tabs is activated and visible
    $("#profile_tabs_friends_content").bind('bettertabs-after-activate', function(){
      alert('friends content is visible');
    });
    
    // Display the $('#loading-clock') element while ajax tabs are loading
    $("#profile_tabs").bind('bettertabs-before-ajax-loading', function(){
      $('#loading-clock').show();
    }).bind('bettertabs-after-ajax-loading', function(){
      $('#loading-clock').hide();
    });


## CSS Styles ##

Bettertabs provides a rails helper to generate HTML and a jQuery plugin as JavaScript, but not any CSS styles because those are very different for each project and can not be abstracted into a common purpose CSS stylesheet.
  
Perhaps the most important CSS rule here is to define `display: none;` for `div.content.hidden`, because contents are never hidden using the jquery.hide() method or similar. The jquery.bettertabs plugin just adds the `.active` class to the active tab and active content, and the `.hidden` class to the non active content. You will need to use a CSS rule like this:

      div.bettertabs div.content.hidden { display: none; }

Use the [Bettertabs CSS Guidelines](https://github.com/agoragames/bettertabs/blob/master/doc/STYLESHEETS-GUIDE.md) to get a stylesheet that you can use as a starting point.


## How to help make Bettertabs even Better ##
 
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.


## Future work ##

  * Try to make it compatible with ruby 1.8.x
  * Improve tests to check the JavaScript code (Jasmine, Evergreen, Capybara, whatever)
